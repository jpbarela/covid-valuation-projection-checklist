# COVID-19 Major Medication Projection Checklist

In a normal year, a major medical plan may be able to determine it's current status to budget with a
few common tools or calculations such as an Incurred But Not Paid (IBNP) calculation. However given
the disruption to the health care system determining the current profitability of a plan may be
difficult to determine.

This page is designed to be a collaborative guide to helping health plans and others at risk for
major medical insurance to accurately project the current and future state of the plan.

## IBNP

- [ ] COVID-19 case count
    Do you have an accurate data on high cost COVID-19 cases? Do you have any initial estimates
    from severity such as a utilization review system?
- [ ] Elective case count
    Do you have an estimates on the fall in elective procedures such as data from a prior
    authorization system?
- [ ] Prescription Duration Adjustments
    For plans that include pharmacy have you seen prescription durations increase potentially
    creating more "seasonality" in your pharmacy claims, e.g. March high, April and May low, another
    bump in June, due to a large number of 90 fills in March?

## Deferred vs Avoided Care

Determining future care liabilities in many cases This section lists some items to consider during
scenario development for future liabilities. Additional data including likely impact's across
service types can be found at the Society of Actuaries [Impact of COVID-19 on Deferred Medical Costs
 and Future Pent-Up
Demand](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2020/covid-19-deferred-medical-cost/)
Research Brief.

- [ ] Provider capacity
    Once "normal" returns to a geography, what is your estimate that the health system future
    non-COVID-19 capacity? Do you need to model both increases above your baseline estimate for
    providers having spare capacity and impairments due to ongoing COVID-19 related care.
- [ ] COVID-19 Related Care
    Do you need to estimate future COVID-19 related care? Is that estimate consistent with the
    non-COVID-19 related capacity. Are you modeling these expenses as more of a steady or do you
    include the possibility of a second wave?
- [ ] Market mix
    Based on the overall capacity of the geography what do you think future market mix for the
    health system will be? Will certain segments be depressed either by patient choice, commercial
    members returning to the health system before Medicare members? Or by provider choice, early
    outreach, preferential scheduling of commercial members before Medicare/Medicaid members?
- [ ] Chronic Severity
    Have physical distance measures resulting in a worsening of health for members with chronic
    conditions? Does this impact future claims?

## Premium Deficiency Reserves (PDR)

- [ ] Contract Continuation
    Some states are requiring continuation of the policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. While these
    premiums are earned, given economic disruptions, this may lead to a higher than normal allowance
    for bad debt.
- [ ] 2021 Rate Review
    As the rate review process continues for 2021, what are assumptions/scenarios that would cause
    a plan to generate a PDR? Can you model these to generate early operational indicators that a
    PDR is needed?

## Provider Contracting

- [ ] Current Year Risk Reserve
    Based on current projections you may need to adjust reserves for risk-based provider contracts.
    These contracts may or may not be positive in the plan's favor based on the local geography's
    exposure to COVID-19.
- [ ] Current Year Measurement Adjustments (Risk/Quality)
    Based on the disruption of the health system, do you need to proactively adjust a provider
    quality metric. For example, if you require two measurements per year of HbA1c for patients with
    diabetes, is that measure still appropriate? If your provider quality measurement year runs from
    July to July, do you need to make adjustments based on an inability for patients/providers to
    receive/perform services?
- [ ] Prior Year Reporting Adjustments (Risk/Quality)
    Do you need to adjust the receipt of any prior year reporting based on provider operational disruptions?
- [ ] Future Year Contract Provisions
    Based on this year's disruption of the health system should you begin to work with a provider
    group to alter the impact of this year on future years contract? Will this year lead to an
    abnormally high or low baseline year that can/should be avoided?

## ACA Plans

### Medical Loss Ratio Reserve (MLR)

- [ ] Review of Incurred Claims
    An overall lower claim projection for the year may result in a rebate back to members based on
    the medical loss ratio. Do you have enough information to start projecting this rebate if
    applicable?
- [ ] Provision of Bad Debt
    Note that based on your state regulations, there may be an abnormal number of months in which
    members are covered but for which you cannot collect premiums which is an adjustment to the MLR.

### Risk Adjustment

- [ ] Priority Evaluation and Management (E&M) Visits
    Given the anticipated bottle necks in care delivery at the end of the year, can you start
    scheduling with known high risk score members who do not have an E&M visit to guarantee a
    recorded score? Do you need to reach out to some members with chronic conditions now to ensure
    that they have a covered E&M visit in case they do not continue with your plan after the
    epidemic.
